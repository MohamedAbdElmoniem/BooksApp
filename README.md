# My React Native Book Search App

Welcome to my React Native app that allows you to search for books on Open Library and view their details! This app is built using React Native and fetches data from the Open Library API. Here's how the app works:

## Features

**Book Search Screen:** The app features a search screen where users can search for books by entering keywords in the search input.

**Search Button:** After entering keywords, users can hit the search button to initiate the search for books on Open Library.

**Backend API Integration:** The app communicates with the Open Library API to fetch books based on the user's search keywords.

**Book Selection:** Users can tap on a specific book from the search results to view more details about that book.

**Overlay Book Details:** Upon selecting a book, an overlay is displayed showing the book's details in a user-friendly manner.

**Add to favourite/currently reading list:** you can add/remove selected book to favourites list or currently reading books list.

**Swipe Down to Close book details overlay:** To close the book details overlay, users can simply swipe down, providing an intuitive way to navigate back to the search results.
